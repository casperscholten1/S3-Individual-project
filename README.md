# Learning outcome 1. Web application

> **Learning outcome:**  You design and build  **user-friendly**,  **full-stack**  web applications.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **User friendly:**  You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.
> 
> **Full-stack:**  You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end
> techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing
> relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous
> communication issues.

**Front-end**

Het Javascript framework dat ik ga gebruiken voor dit project is React. Van te voren heb ik van Angular, React en Vue (de drie grootste) allemaal een tutorial gevolgd. Hierdoor heb ik een keuze kunnen maken met welk framework ik het prettigst kan werken. Dit is uiteindelijk React geworden. Dit komt vooral doordat React een duidelijke tutorial had die voor mij eenvoudig te volgen was. Verder is React het meest populair, wat betekend dat hier ook de meeste informatie over te vinden zal zijn.

Door vooral de verschillen in de tutorials van bovengenoemde frameworks te vergelijken is uiteindelijk dus mijn keuze gevallen op React.

# Learning outcome 2. Software quality

> **Learning outcome:**  You use software  **tooling and methodology**  that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during
> software development.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Tooling and methodology:**  Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security
> and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and
> code reviews.

# Learning outcome 3. Agile method

> **Learning outcome:**  You  **choose**  and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Choose:**  You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and
> based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

# Learning outcome 4. CI/CD

> **Learning outcome:**  You  **design and implement**  a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the
> project context.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Design and implement:**  You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI
> and Docker).

# Learning outcome 5. Cultural differences and ethics

> **Learning outcome:**  You  **recognize**  and  **take into account**  cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects
> in software development.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Recognize:**  Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software
> engineering.
> 
> **Take into account:**
> 
> Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to reflect
> project stakeholders from different cultures;
> 
> Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM
> Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.

# Learning outcome 6. Requirements and Design

> **Learning outcome**: You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using  **multiple
> types of test techniques.**
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Multiple types of test techniques:**  You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the
> requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing
> or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties
> like security and performance.

# Learning outcome 7. Business processes

> **Learning outcome:**  You analyze and describe  **simple**  business processes that are  **related**  to your project.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Simple:**  Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.
> 
> **Related:**  Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must
> support by fully or partially automating them).
> 
> or
> 
> Business processes needed for the success of your software development
> project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).

# Learning outcome 8. Professional

> **Learning outcome:**  You act in a  **professional manner**  during software development and learning.
> 
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Professional manner:**
> 
> You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them
> on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
> 
> You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.
